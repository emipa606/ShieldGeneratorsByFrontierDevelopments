Include as much info as possible, mod list, screenshots, console logs.

Allows for the building shield generators. Shields will stop projectiles that try to enter it but allow weapons to be fired out.  This includes bullets, rockets, mortar rounds, pods of **any** variety (enemies via drop pods, cargo pods, escape pods, and yes, **your** pods).  Shields have low idle power use and high power usage when stopping projectiles.  Shield strength is determined from stored battery power.  More batteries equals more protection.

**Features:**
- PERFORMANCE OPTIONS: For late game colonies or low-power systems, see mod options
- Stop projectiles (bullets, rockets, grenades, mortars, drop pods)
- Shields use a small amount of idle power
- Shield strength is the stored energy on your power net
- Shields generators will heat up as the shields absorb damage and will shut off if they overheat
- Shields come in three sizes:
- small (3m)
- medium (3m - 10m)
- large (5m - 25m)
- The small shield is minifiable and portable and contains an internal battery (1000 Wd, 50% efficient)
- Larger shields can soak more heat before the shield collapses

**Shields Don&apos;t:**
- Stop movement of pawns in or out of the shields
- Stop fires
- Heal people
- Stop fires from explosions from propagating into the shield (Tip: don&apos;t stand near the edge if the bad guy has an incendiary launcher)

**Compatability:**
- No known mod conflicts

**Supported Mods:**
- Combat Extended: It just works
- Centralized Climate Control: Cool shields with air nets **NOW DIRECTLY INTEGRATED**
- Crash Landing: Ship chunks are stopped (and destroyed) by your shields
- Fluffly&apos;s Mod Manager
- SRTS: No longer do you need to shrink shields to use them
- Trader Ships: Can pass through your shields
